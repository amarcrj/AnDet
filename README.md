# AnDet: ML-Based Anomaly Detection of UEs in a Multi-cell B5G Mobile Network for Improved QoS

# Published in: 2024 International Conference on Computing, Networking and Communications (ICNC)

# Abstract
The rise of 5G technology has revolutionized wireless communication, ushering in a new era of unparalleled connectivity. Approaching Beyond 5G networks, Software Defined Networks have emerged as a promising paradigm to enhance flexibility and scalability in cellular networks. However, the challenge of 5G is to ensure the network's performance based on the different Quality of Service requirements for offering interactive services. Proactive detection of anomalies can significantly improve network performance. To address this issue, we present AnDet, a robust ML-based model specifically designed for anomaly detection in SDN-enabled B5G cellular networks. Next, we deploy the proposed AnDet for anomaly detection on SDN-enabled B5G cellular networks, enhancing overall network performance and reliability. Moreover, we incorporate Explainable AI approaches into the AnDet model to ensure transparency and interpretability. Finally, we capture different performance metrics for models and deployments to evaluate the proposed solution. The extensive simulation results show that AnDet effectively identifies anomalies in SDN-enabled cellular networks operating in B5G environments, achieving an impressive 97.2% accuracy in anomaly detection.
